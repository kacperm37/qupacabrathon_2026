    probabilities that need not be equal. Under any classical strategy the mean
    of those probabilities is at most `bound`; the tail of the pooled count is
    maximised over fixed-mean vectors by the i.i.d. binomial at that mean
    (Hoeffding 1956, Theorem 5); and the binomial tail is monotone in its mean.
    So P(Bin(N, bound) >= k) dominates the true tail. Both steps were
    re-verified on 19 August 2026, including the Jensen argument on the
    log-MGF, and `_check_gate_validity` keeps the exact-convolution check
    permanent.

    Equal shots per circuit is load-bearing: it is what makes the pooled mean
    the estimand. The verifier's per-circuit `sum(counts[c]) == shots` check
    enforces it.

    This replaced a transcription of the ion paper's empirical-Bernstein
    expression on 19 August 2026. That expression mixes shot-level and
    circuit-level granularities and matches no published bound; it is
    accidentally conservative, silently enforcing 6.1 to 6.9 sigma where it
    said 3, so results certified under it stand a fortiori, and the exact test
    is 26-59% cheaper per certification.

    Returns 1.0 when the pooled count is at or below the null mean, preserving
    the old `eps <= 0` guard semantics: landing exactly on the bound is
    evidence of nothing.

    a team hands in both of them, because the dollars are spent across both
    and the record is one. The twirl count, read off the submitted script's
    parameter block and 1 when the block carries none, puts a twirled run's
    extra task fees into the numerator, so the spend scored here is the spend
    the ledger metered; the denominator stays the untwirled S_90 sweep, so a
    twirl that buys no larger record raises the score.

        record = largest n certified at p_target
        delta  = omega_q(record) - mean(winrates of the run that certified it)

    revealed, priced on the device that run went to: the cheapest run a team
    that knew its device exactly would have published. Exactly 1.0 for a team
    that ran that sweep and stopped.

    Pricing the denominator on the record run's own device is what keeps the
    two QPUs comparable. Garnet's per-shot rate is about 10% below Emerald's,
    so a Garnet weekend put over an Emerald-priced denominator would score
    about 9% better for choosing the cheaper machine, which is not a planning
    decision this award is meant to reward. Same device top and bottom, and
    the rate very nearly cancels.

    The clamp is load-bearing on a continuous meter. An under-bought run that
    clears the gate by luck spends less than the honestly sized sweep, and
    without the clamp that gamble would outscore every team that followed the
    published tables; with it, the gamble ties the perfect plan at 1.0 and
    beats nobody. A run that missed the gate is not free either: its dollars
    stay in the numerator while the denominator counts only what the record
    cost, so a failed gamble is what this award punishes. A skipped run adds
    $0, which is why skipping run 1 is a legitimate strategy.

    Worked weekends at the illustration delta = 0.015: a one-shot S_90 commit
    at n = 13 ($10.00) scores 1.00; certifying n = 9 and then n = 11 ($14.67
    against the $8.15 the record needed) scores 1.80; the same n = 13 commit
    run twice scores 2.00.

    Nothing here reads a published deficit, and the award needed no change when
    the event stopped publishing one. The denominator is built from the deficit
    the team's own winning run revealed, so a team that measures its device
    unlocks a larger record and a larger denominator at once, and a team that
    predicts from published specs over-buys and pays for it here. Calibration
    is rewarded by the arithmetic rather than by a rule.

    First, recompute the drop the long way. Build the four outcome probabilities
    of one question from the angle between the two players' rotations, push each
    through the bit-flip channel by summing over which of the two bits flipped,
    and read the win probability off the result. That path never uses $2p(1-p)$

    strategy is optimal under the channel, as an identity rather than a
    search result.

    Numeric: widening the family to tilted real states
    $\\cos\\gamma\\,|00\\rangle + \\sin\\gamma\\,|11\\rangle$ with arbitrary
    per-vertex angles for both players, a hill-climb from the textbook point
    and from random starts finds nothing that beats the textbook strategy at
    $n = 5$ under $(e_0, e_1) = (0.001, 0.02)$, to 1e-6. First run on
    20 August 2026 (also at $n = 13$ and $e_1$ up to 3%, where the optimiser
    pinned $\\gamma = \\pi/4$ and the textbook angles); this check keeps a
    coarse version of that scan permanent. The scan covers real states and
    real rotations, which is the strategy family the challenge uses.
